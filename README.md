# Frontend Developer Test

Please create new php page from given mockup. Just a single landing page.

1. The mockup file is located on https://github.com/bylabz/frontend-test/blob/master/assets/images/mockup.png.
	Or you can simply clone this github repository (https://github.com/bylabz/frontend-test.git) into 
	your local machine.
1. Feel free to use your favorite css framework, bootstrap, materialize css, and etc. 
1. All the icons and the other images you need should be available on that github repository. 
	https://github.com/bylabz/frontend-test/tree/master/assets  
1. You should use the same fonts as the mockup needed. For example this section title (http://i.prntscr.com/96t7lWY_RNSAP_8YKbd1hw.png) 
	must be Montserrat-Bold.
1. Please don't put a hardcode value of the price (http://i.prntscr.com/nuCmy2U3Trm2ip7wimzDXA.png). 
	You can store the price value on database or json data, so the price will be dynamically.
1. And for sure, take care of the mobile view. Make sure that your page not break on mobile device resolution.
1. Finally, please give us your page on both preview url and link of your code repository.
	
Note : if you are familiar with twig, using twig on creating your preview page is much better.
